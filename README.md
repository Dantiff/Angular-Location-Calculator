# Angular Location Calculator

This is a one page calculator. The user would complete the three inputs at the top and receive calculations from an api on submit. 

There is a mock data endpoint that you can use. It will respond to a POST request - https://technekes.mockable.io/ngc-calculator-api/calculations.
